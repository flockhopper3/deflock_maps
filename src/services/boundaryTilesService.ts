/**
 * US administrative boundaries served as a plain vector tileset (MVT) from the
 * flockhopper-tiles worker. One archive, three source-layers, all polygons.
 *
 * Consumed via the TileJSON URL only — MapLibre reads the tile template and
 * zoom range from it (never hardcode the {z}/{x}/{y}.mvt path).
 *
 * Contract (from boundaries-us.json):
 *  - states         z0–12  fields: abbrev ("IL"), name ("Illinois"), fips ("17")
 *  - counties       z2–12  fields: name ("Cook"), state ("IL"), fips ("17031")
 *  - municipalities z5–12  fields: name, type, state ("IL"), county (nullable), fips
 *  - fips is unique within each layer → used as the feature id (promoteId).
